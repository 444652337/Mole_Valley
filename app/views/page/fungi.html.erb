  <p>
    <img src="/images/fungi/Death-Cap.jpg" alt="Amanita phalloides"> <em>Amanita phalloides</em> &mdash; Death Cap.<br>
    Highly toxic, a quarter of a cap kills very unpleasantly &ndash; but not slugs! Most of the Amanita family are poisonous.

    Quite rare and confined to <q>hawthorn scrub on chalk</q>. There is much of this in Mole Valley, and 2004 was a good year for this small and
    elusive spring species. An ascomycete with a hollow stem.
